core >> sales force

all student questions are contained in sales force

can assign new admission staff to lead

can waitlist leads

can assign leads to chosen start dates

prioritize according to start dates\

TODO: can send about me/ coding practice via student portal

TODO: notifies admission staff when prework/coding challenge are submitted

TODO: basic notes section

record all rejects

TODO: all instructors/admin can read notes


ONCE ACCEPTED:
phases: -whether or not they've accepted
-have they made a deposit
-have the signed enrollment agreement
-have they gotten their prework

PAIN POINT:
creates secondary leads (talked to dana today, dana signs up for info session, sales force creates new lead for dana)

there is no continuity


sales force cannot select dates
sales force is NOT user friendly, not consumer facing

maybe create a way to send accepted students list to the instructors, they can continue to take notes and read other's notes
